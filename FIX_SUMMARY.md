# Agent Notification and Removal Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
Agents were moving to finished status but:
1. Telegram notifications were not being sent
2. Agents were not being removed from the manager
3. The queue was getting blocked
4. WaitForMultipleAgents function was unused

## Root Cause Analysis
The investigation revealed that:
1. The monitor WAS attempting to send notifications and remove agents
2. The real issue was zombie processes - agents stuck in "running" state when their process died
3. The monitor only checked agent status, not actual process health
4. Dead processes left agents in "running" state forever, preventing cleanup

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Process Health Checking
- Added `IsProcessAlive()` method to Agent to check if the process is still running
- Uses signal 0 to verify process existence without affecting it

### 2. Updated Monitor for Zombie Detection
- Monitor now checks for zombie processes (status=running but process is dead)
- Automatically marks zombie agents as failed
- Added retry logic for failed removals

### 3. Added Safe Status Update Method
- Created `MarkAsFailed()` method for thread-safe status updates
- Ensures proper synchronization when updating agent state

### 4. Improved Error Recovery
- Added tracking of failed removals with retry on next cycle
- Prevents duplicate notifications while retrying removals

### 5. Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `WaitForMultipleAgents` function
- Identified other unused functions for future cleanup

## Tests Created
1. **TestAgentCompletionAndRemoval** - Verifies agents are properly removed after completion
2. **TestQueueProcessingAfterCompletion** - Ensures queued agents start after first completes
3. **TestAgentZombieProcessDetection** - Tests zombie process detection and cleanup
4. **TestMonitorZombieDetection** - Verifies monitor detects and notifies about zombies

## Results
- Agents are now properly detected when they become zombies
- Notifications are sent reliably
- Agents are removed from the manager after completion
- Queue processing continues properly
- All tests pass successfully

## Additional Unused Code Found
- `StartAsync()` in agent.go
- `GetError()` in agent.go  
- `GetmDNSInstructions()` in utils.go
- `UnmapAllPorts()` in upnp.go
- `GetQueuedAgentByFolder()` in queue_tracker.go

These can be removed in a future cleanup pass.
