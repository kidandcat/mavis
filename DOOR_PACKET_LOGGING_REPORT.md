# Door Packet Logging Task Report

## Task
"in the door, log when a packet is sent (> target command)"

## Investigation Results

After comprehensive search of the codebase, I found:

1. **No "door" functionality exists** - Only one reference to "door" found in a test file comment
2. **No "> target" command pattern** - The application uses "/" prefix for Telegram bot commands
3. **No packet sending code** - Communication happens via Telegram Bot API, not direct packet sending
4. **No targeting mechanism** - Messages are sent to chat IDs via Telegram API

## Codebase Architecture

The application is structured as:
- **Telegram Bot Interface**: Handles commands with "/" prefix (e.g., /code, /ps, /status)
- **Web UI**: HTTP-based interface with REST API endpoints
- **Agent System**: Launches Claude CLI agents for code tasks
- **Soul System**: Manages iterative development cycles

## Conclusion

The requested feature to "log when a packet is sent (> target command) in the door" cannot be implemented because:
1. There is no "door" component in the codebase
2. The application doesn't use "> target" command syntax
3. There are no packet-level operations to log

If this is a new feature request, it would require:
1. Implementing a new "door" component
2. Adding support for "> target" command syntax
3. Creating packet-level communication infrastructure
4. Adding logging for packet transmission

Please clarify if this is a new feature to be implemented or if there's a different component where this logging should be added.
