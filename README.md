## üöÄ Deployment

### Green Deployment Restart
Mavis supports zero-downtime restarts using a green deployment strategy:
- The `/restart` command (admin only) builds a new binary with a timestamp
- Starts the new process and waits for it to initialize
- Gracefully shuts down the old process
- Automatically cleans up old binaries

### Using systemd (Linux)
```bash
# Create a service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mavis.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Mavis Telegram Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-user
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/mavis
ExecStart=/path/to/mavis/mavis

Environment="PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable mavis
sudo systemctl start mavis
```

### Continuous Running Script
The included `run.sh` script ensures the bot stays running:
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Using Docker
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o mavis

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates git
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/mavis .
